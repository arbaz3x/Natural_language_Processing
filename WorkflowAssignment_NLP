In my NLP_Assignment.ipynb im using a kaggle built in dataset to apply nltk and spacy ftns.
first dataframes are created for every csv file.
Nltk is applied on that df to get tokenization, stemming and lemmatization.
Spcay is applied to get tokenization and lemmatization.
Both are visually compared but in end a sample text is also used for better comparison.
for Task 3 sentiment analysis is done on bert-base-ner model
for task 4 cbow and skip gram techniques are done on a raw corpus of text using genism.
